This is a repository for open source libraries and source code snippets that I've developed at NVIDIA and/or my free time.

This code is shared by the [NVIDIA Texture Tools](http://code.google.com/p/nvidia-texture-tools/) and the [NVIDIA Mesh Processing Tools](http://code.google.com/p/nvidia-mesh-tools/), but contains also other miscellaneous utilities and source files that did not fit in any of those projects.
